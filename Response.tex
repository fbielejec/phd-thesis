\item {
{\it
\textbf{
It is sometimes unclear in Chapter 2 whether the analysis is performed under a fixed evolutionary tree or not. 
This is especially so in the evaluation of Bayes Factors in Table 2.3. 
It would also have been nice to understand better whether the use of the epoch model (versus not) has an essential impact on tree reconstruction. 
Somewhat related, it would have been nice to learn from the simulation study how mislead one could be if the data were generated under an epoch model, but analyzed under a simpler model. 
I am not asking for additional analyses here, but merely for additional clarification or insight.

\section*{Comments by David Posada}

\begin{itemize}

% 1
\item {
{\it
\textbf{
I missed a brief primer of Bayesian model selection in the introductory chapter.
Techniques such Bayes factors, path sampling or stepping-stone sampling are used throughout but never explained. 
This should be very easy to fix.
}% END: textbf
}% END: it
}% END: item


% 2
\item {
{\it
\textbf{
In the simulations in Chapter 2 you assume you know the true epoch times, but this information is rarely available in real life. 
Simulation 1 addresses the impact of model misspecification partially, as the true process does not have epochs. 
It could be a good idea to further check the impact of model misspecification, in particular simulating a number of epochs that do not correspond with the assumed ones (you later mention this idea in the final chapter but do not end up testing its potential biasing effect). 
Also, simulating under a non-epoch model - for example where different process can apply to contemporaneous branches, would be fundamental to understand the robustness of the model. 
This does not need to be done before the defense, but it could be a nice extension for the future.

\item {
{\it
\textbf{
In general, there is some repetitive text, sometimes with identical phrases/paragraphs, between the introduction and some of the other chapters. 
On the other hand, some relevant aspects of the research are discussed in the general discussion in Chapter 5, instead of in the corresponding `research' chapter. 
This is true in particular for Chapter 3, were a very concise description of SPREAD is provided. 
I understand these redundancies and fragmentations are a byproduct of reproducing papers as chapters, but however these issues have been corrected in some occasions. 
For example, chapter 2 is not identical to the SysBio paper. 
I suggest you try a bit to further consolidate the different chapters.

\textbf{
The simulation software piBUSS described in Chapter 4 can be very useful, in particular in regards to its connectivity with BEAST. 
The possibility of simulating discrete phylogeographic traits is very convenient. 
Here it would have been interesting to see, for the sake of comparison and interpretation, the correspondence between simulated and estimated tMRCAs when the true model has one epoch with omega=0.5 (or even better, omega equal to the weighted mean of the n-epoch model). 
This does not need to be done before the defense, but it could be a nice extension for the future.

Page 14: I would say that the term `Big Data' does not apply to sequence alignments. 
It might do for NGS files etc., but not for the type of data that BEAST uses as input. 
Not yet. 
Moreover, you focus on HPC architectures like GPU and multicores, which are in some senses opposite to Big Data architectures (i.e., Hadoop Map Reduce).
