abstract ={Motivation: TipDate is a program that will use sequences that
  have been isolated at different dates to estimate their rate of
  molecular evolution. The program provides a maximum likelihood
  estimate of the rate and also the associated date of the most recent
  common ancestor of the sequences, under a model which assumes a
  constant rate of substitution (molecular clock) but which
  accommodates the dates of isolation. Confidence intervals for these
  parameters are also estimated.Results: The approach was applied to a sample of 17 dengue virus
  serotype 4 sequences, isolated at dates ranging from 1956 to 1994.
  The rate of substitution for this serotype was estimated to be 7.91
  × 10−4 substitutions per site per year (95% confidence
  intervals of 6.07 × 10−4, 9.86 × 10−4). This
  is compatible with a date of 1922 (95% confidence intervals of
  1900–1936) for the most recent common ancestor of these
  sequences.Availability: TipDate can be obtained by WWW from http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software.
  The package includes the source code, manual and example files. Both
  UNIX and Apple Macintosh versions are available from the same
  site.Contact: andrew.rambaut@zoo.ox.ac.uk},

title = {Genealogical Inference From Microsatellite Data},
volume = {150}, 
number = {1}, 
pages = {499-510}, 
year = {1998}, 
abstract ={Ease and accuracy of typing, together with high levels of polymorphism and widespread distribution in the genome, make microsatellite (or short tandem repeat) loci an attractive potential source of information about both population histories and evolutionary processes. However, microsatellite data are difficult to interpret, in particular because of the frequency of back-mutations. Stochastic models for the underlying genetic processes can be specified, but in the past they have been too complicated for direct analysis. Recent developments in stochastic simulation methodology now allow direct inference about both historical events, such as genealogical coalescence times, and evolutionary parameters, such as mutation rates. A feature of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that we propose here is that the likelihood computations are simplified by treating the (unknown) ancestral allelic states as auxiliary parameters. We illustrate the algorithm by analyzing microsatellite samples simulated under the model. Our results suggest that a single microsatellite usually does not provide enough information for useful inferences, but that several completely linked microsatellites can be informative about some aspects of genealogical history and evolutionary processes. We also reanalyze data from a previously published human Y chromosome microsatellite study, finding evidence for an effective population size for human Y chromosomes in the low thousands and a recent time since their most recent common ancestor: the 95% interval runs from ~15,000 to 130,000 years, with most likely values around 30,000 years.},

abstract = {The rate of evolution of an RNA plant virus has never been estimated using temporally spaced sequence data, by contrast to the information available on an increasing range of animal viruses. Accordingly, the evolution rate of Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) was calculated from sequences of the coat protein gene of isolates collected from rice over a 40-year period in different parts of Africa. The evolution rate of RYMV was estimated by pairwise distance linear regression on five phylogeographically defined groups comprising a total of 135 isolates. It was further assessed from 253 isolates collected all over Africa by Bayesian coalescent methods under strict and relaxed molecular clock models and under constant size and skyline population genetic models. Consistent estimates of the evolution rate between 4 × 10−4 and 8 × 10−4 nucleotides (nt)/site/year were obtained whatever method and model were applied. The synonymous evolution rate was between 8 × 10−4 and 11 × 10−4 nt/site/year. The overall and synonymous evolution rates of RYMV were within the range of the rates of 50 RNA animal viruses, below the average but above the distribution median. Experimentally, in host change studies, substitutions accumulated at an even higher rate. The results show that an RNA plant virus such as RYMV evolves as rapidly as most RNA animal viruses. Knowledge of the molecular clock of plant viruses provides methods for testing a wide range of biological hypotheses.},

abstract ={We present a Bayesian statistical inference approach for simultaneously estimating mutation rate, population sizes, and migration rates in an island-structured population, using temporal and spatial sequence data. Markov chain Monte Carlo is used to collect samples from the posterior probability distribution. We demonstrate that this chain implementation successfully reaches equilibrium and recovers truth for simulated data. A real HIV DNA sequence data set with two demes, semen and blood, is used as an example to demonstrate the method by fitting asymmetric migration rates and different population sizes. This data set exhibits a bimodal joint posterior distribution, with modes favoring different preferred migration directions. This full data set was subsequently split temporally for further analysis. Qualitative behavior of one subset was similar to the bimodal distribution observed with the full data set. The temporally split data showed significant differences in the posterior distributions and estimates of parameter values over time.},

pages = {1081-1090}, 
year = {2000}, 
abstract ={Protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial genomes from 31 mammalian species were analyzed to estimate the speciation dates within primates and also between rats and mice. Three calibration points were used based on paleontological data: one at 20–25 MYA for the hominoid/cercopithecoid divergence, one at 53–57 MYA for the cetacean/artiodactyl divergence, and the third at 110–130 MYA for the metatherian/eutherian divergence. Both the nucleotide and the amino acid sequences were analyzed, producing conflicting results. The global molecular clock was clearly violated for both the nucleotide and the amino acid data. Models of local clocks were implemented using maximum likelihood, allowing different evolutionary rates for some lineages while assuming rate constancy in others. Surprisingly, the highly divergent third codon positions appeared to contain phylogenetic information and produced more sensible estimates of primate divergence dates than did the amino acid sequences. Estimated dates varied considerably depending on the data type, the calibration point, and the substitution model but differed little among the four tree topologies used. We conclude that the calibration derived from the primate fossil record is too recent to be reliable; we also point out a number of problems in date estimation when the molecular clock does not hold. Despite these obstacles, we derived estimates of primate divergence dates that were well supported by the data and were generally consistent with the paleontological record. Estimation of the mouse-rat divergence date, however, was problematic.},

abstract ={Nonhomogeneous substitution models have been introduced for phylogenetic inference when the substitution process is nonstationary, for example, when sequence composition differs between lineages. Existing models can have many parameters, and it is then difficult and computationally expensive to learn the parameters and to select the optimal model complexity. We extend an existing nonhomogeneous substitution model by introducing a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method for efficient Bayesian inference of the model order along with other phylogenetic parameters of interest. We also introduce a new hierarchical prior which leads to more reasonable results when only a small number of lineages share a particular substitution process. The method is implemented in the PHASE software, which includes specialized substitution models for RNA genes with conserved secondary structure. We apply an RNA-specific nonhomogeneous model to a structure-based alignment of rRNA sequences spanning the entire tree of life. A previous study of the same genes from a similar set of species found robust evidence for a mesophilic last universal common ancestor (LUCA) by inference of the G + C composition at the root of the tree. In the present study, we find that the helical GC composition at the root is strongly dependent on the root position. With a bacterial rooting, we find that there is no longer strong support for either a mesophile or a thermophile LUCA, although a hyperthermophile LUCA remains unlikely. We discuss reasons why results using only RNA helices may differ from results using all aligned sites when applying nonhomogeneous models to RNA genes.},

abstract ={We combined the category (CAT) mixture model (Lartillot N, Philippe H. 2004) and the nonstationary break point (BP) model (Blanquart S, Lartillot N. 2006) into a new model, CAT–BP, accounting for variations of the evolutionary process both along the sequence and across lineages. As in CAT, the model implements a mixture of distinct Markovian processes of substitution distributed among sites, thus accommodating site-specific selective constraints induced by protein structure and function. Furthermore, as in BP, these processes are nonstationary, and their equilibrium frequencies are allowed to change along lineages in a correlated way, through discrete shifts in global amino acid composition distributed along the phylogenetic tree. We implemented the CAT–BP model in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework and compared its predictions with those of 3 simpler models, BP, CAT, and the site- and time-homogeneous general time–reversible (GTR) model, on a concatenation of 4 mitochondrial proteins of 20 arthropod species. In contrast to GTR, BP, and CAT, which all display a phylogenetic reconstruction artifact positioning the bees Apis mellifera and Melipona bicolor among chelicerates, the CAT–BP model is able to recover the monophyly of insects. Using posterior predictive tests, we further show that the CAT–BP combination yields better anticipations of site- and taxon-specific amino acid frequencies and that it better accounts for the homoplasies that are responsible for the artifact. Altogether, our results show that the joint modeling of heterogeneities across sites and along time results in a synergistic improvement of the phylogenetic inference, indicating that it is essential to disentangle the combined effects of both sources of heterogeneity, in order to overcome systematic errors in protein phylogenetic analyses.},

abstract ={The three-domains tree, which depicts eukaryotes and archaebacteria as monophyletic sister groups, is the dominant model for early eukaryotic evolution. By contrast, the ‘eocyte hypothesis’, where eukaryotes are proposed to have originated from within the archaebacteria as sister to the Crenarchaeota (also called the eocytes), has been largely neglected in the literature. We have investigated support for these two competing hypotheses from molecular sequence data using methods that attempt to accommodate the across-site compositional heterogeneity and across-tree compositional and rate matrix heterogeneity that are manifest features of these data. When ribosomal RNA genes were analysed using standard methods that do not adequately model these kinds of heterogeneity, the three-domains tree was supported. However, this support was eroded or lost when composition-heterogeneous models were used, with concomitant increase in support for the eocyte tree for eukaryotic origins. Analysis of combined amino acid sequences from 41 protein-coding genes supported the eocyte tree, whether or not composition-heterogeneous models were used. The possible effects of substitutional saturation of our data were examined using simulation; these results suggested that saturation is delayed by among-site rate variation in the sequences, and that phylogenetic signal for ancient relationships is plausibly present in these data.},

abstract ={Compositional heterogeneity among lineages can compromise phylogenetic analyses, because models in common use assume compositionally homogeneous data. Models that can accommodate compositional heterogeneity with few extra parameters are described here, and used in two examples where the true tree is known with confidence. It is shown using likelihood ratio tests that adequate modeling of compositional heterogeneity can be achieved with few composition parameters, that the data may not need to be modelled with separate composition parameters for each branch in the tree. Tree searching and placement of composition vectors on the tree are done in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Assessment of fit of the model to the data is made in both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian frameworks. In an ML framework, overall model fit is assessed using the Goldman-Cox test, and the fit of the composition implied by a (possibly heterogeneous) model to the composition of the data is assessed using a novel tree- and model-based composition fit test. In a Bayesian framework, overall model fit and composition fit are assessed using posterior predictive simulation. It is shown that when composition is not accommodated, then the model does not fit, and incorrect trees are found; but when composition is accommodated, the model then fits, and the known correct phylogenies are obtained.},

abstract ={Recent advances in heuristics have made maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree estimation tractable for hundreds of sequences. Noticeably, these algorithms are currently limited to reversible models of evolution, in which Felsenstein's pulley principle applies. In this paper we show that by reorganizing the way likelihood is computed, one can efficiently compute the likelihood of a tree from any of its nodes with a nonreversible model of DNA sequence evolution, and hence benefit from cutting-edge heuristics. This computational trick can be used with reversible models of evolution without any extra cost. We then introduce nhPhyML, the adaptation of the nonhomogeneous nonstationary model of Galtier and Gouy (1998; Mol. Biol. Evol. 15:871–879) to the structure of PhyML, as well as an approximation of the model in which the set of equilibrium frequencies is limited. This new version shows good results both in terms of exploration of the space of tree topologies and ancestral G+C content estimation. We eventually apply it to rRNA sequences slowly evolving sites and conclude that the model and a wider taxonomic sampling still do not plead for a hyperthermophilic last universal common ancestor.},

abstract ={A new method for computing evolutionary distances between DNA sequences is proposed. Contrasting with classical methods, the underlying model does not assume that sequence base compositions (A, C, G, and T contents) are at equilibrium, thus allowing unequal base compositions among compared sequences. This makes the method more efficient than the usual ones in recovering phylogenetic trees from sequence data when base composition is heterogeneous within the data set, as we show by using both simulated and empirical data. When applied to small-subunit ribosomal RNA sequences from several prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms, this method provides evidence for an early divergence of the microsporidian Vairimorpha necatrix in the eukaryotic lineage.},

     abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

abstract ={The factors that determine the origin and fate of cross-species transmission events remain unclear for the majority of human pathogens, despite being central for the development of predictive models and assessing the efficacy of prevention strategies. Here, we describe a flexible Bayesian statistical framework to reconstruct virus transmission between different host species based on viral gene sequences, while simultaneously testing and estimating the contribution of several potential predictors of cross-species transmission. Specifically, we use a generalized linear model extension of phylogenetic diffusion to perform Bayesian model averaging over candidate predictors. By further extending this model with branch partitioning, we allow for distinct host transition processes on external and internal branches, thus discriminating between recent cross-species transmissions, many of which are likely to result in dead-end infections, and host shifts that reflect successful onwards transmission in the new host species. Our approach corroborates genetic distance between hosts as a key determinant of both host shifts and cross-species transmissions of rabies virus in North American bats. Furthermore, our results indicate that geographical range overlap is a modest predictor for cross-species transmission, but not for host shifts. Although our evolutionary framework focused on the multi-host reservoir dynamics of bat rabies virus, it is applicable to other pathogens and to other discrete state transition processes.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying the dynamics of intrahost HIV-1 sequence evolution is one means of uncovering information about the interaction between HIV-1 and the host immune system. In the chronic phase of infection, common dynamics of sequence divergence and diversity have been reported. We developed an HIV-1 sequence evolution model that simulated the effects of mutation and fitness of sequence variants. The amount of evolution was described by the distance from the founder strain, and fitness was described by the number of offspring a parent sequence produces. Analysis of the model suggested that the previously observed saturation of divergence and decrease of diversity in later stages of infection can be explained by a decrease in the proportion of offspring that are mutants as the distance from the founder strain increases rather than due to an increase of viral fitness. The prediction of the model was examined by performing phylogenetic analysis to estimate the change in the rate of evolution during infection. In agreement with our modeling, in 13 out of 15 patients (followed for 3-12 years) we found that the rate of intrahost HIV-1 evolution was not constant but rather slowed down at a rate correlated with the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline. The correlation between the dynamics of the evolutionary rate and the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline, coupled with our HIV-1 sequence evolution model, explains previously conflicting observations of the relationships between the rate of HIV-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression.},

	Abstract = {Within-patient HIV populations evolve rapidly because of a high mutation rate, short generation time, and strong positive selection pressures. Previous studies have identified "consistent patterns" of viral sequence evolution. Just before HIV infection progresses to AIDS, evolution seems to slow markedly, and the genetic diversity of the viral population drops. This evolutionary slowdown could be caused either by a reduction in the average viral replication rate or because selection pressures weaken with the collapse of the immune system. The former hypothesis (which we denote "cellular exhaustion") predicts a simultaneous reduction in both synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution, whereas the latter hypothesis (denoted "immune relaxation") predicts that only nonsynonymous evolution will slow. In this paper, we present a set of statistical procedures for distinguishing between these alternative hypotheses using DNA sequences sampled over the course of infection. The first component is a new method for estimating evolutionary rates that takes advantage of the temporal information in longitudinal DNA sequence samples. Second, we develop a set of probability models for the analysis of evolutionary rates in HIV populations in vivo. Application of these models to both synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution affords a comparison of the cellular-exhaustion and immune-relaxation hypotheses. We apply the procedures to longitudinal data sets in which sequences of the env gene were sampled over the entire course of infection. Our analyses (1) statistically confirm that an evolutionary slowdown occurs late in infection, (2) strongly support the immune-relaxation hypothesis, and (3) indicate that the cessation of nonsynonymous evolution is associated with disease progression.},

	Abstract = {The exact mechanisms by which HIV overwhelms the immune system remain poorly understood. Among the several explanations of HIV disease progression, most include adaptation of the viral genome to the host environment as a causal factor. Therefore, quantifying the rate and pattern of adaptive evolution within infected patients is critical to understanding the development of AIDS. Using sequence data from infected individuals sampled at multiple time points, I estimate the within-host adaptation rate of the HIV-1 env gene for viral populations from 50 different patients. I find that, averaging across patients, one adaptive substitution occurs every 3.3 months. Also, one adaptive mutation is driven to a high frequency (>50% but <100%) every 2.5 months. Taken together, such adaptive events occur once every 25 viral generations, which is the fastest adaptation rate ever recorded for a single protein-coding gene. Within the entire env gene, I estimate that a majority ( approximately 55%) of both nonsynonymous substitutions and high-frequency polymorphisms are adaptive. Further, in the C2-V5 region of env, I find that patients with longer asymptomatic periods have virus populations with higher adaptation rates, corroborating the notion that a broad, strong immune response against epitopes in the env gene product leads to longer asymptomatic periods. I conclude by discussing the distribution of nonsynonymous changes over the env gene.},

	Abstract = {The ratio of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution rates, omega, provides a measure of selection at the protein level. Models have been developed that allow omega to vary among lineages. However, these models require the lineages in which differential selection has acted to be specified a priori. We propose a genetic algorithm approach to assign lineages in a phylogeny to a fixed number of different classes of omega, thus allowing variable selection pressure without a priori specification of particular lineages. This approach can identify models with a better fit than a single-ratio model, and with fits that are better than (in an information theoretic sense) a fully local model, in which all lineages are assumed to evolve under different values of omega, but with far fewer parameters. By averaging over models which explain the data reasonably well, we can assess the robustness of our conclusions to uncertainty in model estimation. Our approach can also be used to compare results from models in which branch classes are specified a priori with a wide range of credible models. We illustrate our methods on primate lysozyme sequences and compare them with previous methods applied to the same data sets.},

	Abstract = { A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the ``scatterplot'') and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ``poems.'' Supplemental materials are available online. },

@article{Romiguier2012,
	Abstract = {<p>Genes and genomes do not evolve similarly in all branches of the tree of life. Detecting and characterizing the heterogeneity in time, and between lineages, of the nucleotide (or amino acid) substitution process is an important goal of current molecular evolutionary research. This task is typically achieved through the use of non-homogeneous models of sequence evolution, which being highly parametrized and computationally-demanding are not appropriate for large-scale analyses. Here we investigate an alternative methodological option based on probabilistic substitution mapping. The idea is to first reconstruct the substitutional history of each site of an alignment under a homogeneous model of sequence evolution, then to characterize variations in the substitution process across lineages based on substitution counts. Using simulated and published datasets, we demonstrate that probabilistic substitution mapping is robust in that it typically provides accurate reconstruction of sequence ancestry even when the true process is heterogeneous, but a homogeneous model is adopted. Consequently, we show that the new approach is essentially as efficient as and extremely faster than (up to 25 000 times) existing methods, thus paving the way for a systematic survey of substitution process heterogeneity across genes and lineages.</p>},
